# ajaxendpoint

I built this WordPress plugin for simplistic demonstration purposes only. Basically, it pulls some dummy data remotely from restapiexample.com and cached it for 12 hours. Allowing a WordPress based website (where this plugin is installed) to consume those information locally through RESTful access from an ajax request.

Can be a good starting point for someone wanting to learn more about creating a basic WordPress plugin with some basic REST and ajax usage. Enjoy!
